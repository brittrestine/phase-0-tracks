# How to learn jQuery in two hours
  * look up the docs for jQuery
  * look for intro videos online
  * read stackover flow for help
  * take a couple little breaks to grab water or a snack
  * test what you've learned once you feel like you have a little understanding of the specific topic of jQuery you are looking at

** How I plan to approach the topic**
  * I plan to start with a short intro video (if I can find one), then look up some docs or cheatsheets and give them a look over. I plan to approach jQuery this way because I learn best with a little foundation. I dont have to have a firm grasp, but something to start me off with and videos and practicing on my own is the best way for me to learn.

** The Strategy that worked best **
  * The way I learn on my own the best is to watch a short video, look you a cheat sheet and start to play around with code myself.
