  * Linux philosophies inculed 'Open Source Software' which means this program is available for one to freely download, modify and redistribute. Also Linux assumes the user knows what they are doing and has a complete grasp of the operating system, this is very powerful!

2.In your own words, what is a VPS (virtual private server)? What, according to your research, are the advantages of using a VPS?

  * A VPS is a copy of a operating system, the advantages of using a vps are that first it cost less for the user. Also you can pay for the features you need instead of having featurs you will not use, but you can always upgrade in the future.

3.Optional bonus question: Why is it considered a bad idea to run programs as the root user on a Linux system?

  * It is a bad idea to run the root user on linux because of security reasons. If you have a bug and are in root it could wipe out your entires directory, but if you were in a different user the bug will only have access to limited files.
